# Programming-Classwork
This Reposity serves as a collection of works from past programming courses.
These assignments were either problems from an assigned textbook or were designed by the 
instructor, in order to apply acquired skills for practical use. These codes and scripts
are a combination of textbook examples, professor's initial code, and my own work. 

Some included work are written in:
 C, Java, Python, Perl, Bash Script
